            <div class="quote">I never left a review before but this place was so good I just HAD to leave one. When I went in, the first thing I see
            is this really **** sushi chef named Andy, he took my order and the rest was history. The food came out pretty fast and
            the master chef handed it to me with a smile (OwO) IT WAS AMAZING! I have never tasted food so good in my life.</div>
